Nice 👍
So **your role = Student side (frontend + integration)** in the College Placement System.
That’s perfect, because you already built **Jobs + Notice backend**, so now you’ll connect it to **Student UI**.

I can’t open the Figma directly here, but I’ll guide you exactly what the **Student module should contain** and how to connect it with your APIs.

# 🎓 STUDENT MODULE — WHAT YOU SHOULD BUILD

Think from student perspective:

> “Main student hoon → mujhe jobs, notices, apply, profile sab chahiye”

## 🔹 Student Dashboard Pages

### 1️⃣ Dashboard Home

Shows:

* Latest placement notices
* Latest jobs
* Application status
* Upcoming drives

APIs:

```
GET /jobs
GET /notices
GET /applications (student specific)
```

---

### 2️⃣ Job List Page

Student will:

* View all jobs
* Filter jobs
* Click job → details
* Apply

API:

```
GET /jobs
GET /jobs/:id
POST /applications
```

---

### 3️⃣ Job Details Page

Shows:

* title
* company
* description
* deadline
* apply button

API:

```
GET /jobs/:id
```

---

### 4️⃣ Apply Job

When student clicks Apply:

```
POST /applications
```

Body example:

```json
{
  "jobId": "123456"
}
```

---

### 5️⃣ Notices Page

Student-only placement notices.

API:

```
GET /notices
```

---

### 6️⃣ My Applications Page

Student sees:

* Applied jobs
* Status (Applied/Selected/Rejected)

API:

```
GET /applications?studentId=me
```

---

### 7️⃣ Student Profile Page

Fields:

* name
* branch
* skills
* cgpa
* resume

API:

```
GET /students/me
PUT /students/me
```

---

# 🧱 FRONTEND STRUCTURE (React Suggestion)

```
student/
 ├── Dashboard.jsx
 ├── Jobs.jsx
 ├── JobDetails.jsx
 ├── ApplyJob.jsx
 ├── Notices.jsx
 ├── Applications.jsx
 └── Profile.jsx
```

---

# 🔗 HOW YOUR BACKEND CONNECTS

You already made:

* `/jobs`
* `/notices`

So student frontend will fetch:

```js
axios.get("/app/jobs")
axios.get("/app/notices")
```

---

# 🧠 IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS

### Students CAN:

* View jobs
* Apply jobs
* View notices
* Track applications

### Students CANNOT:

* Post jobs
* Post notices
* Delete jobs

---

# 💡 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU NOW

Tell me:

### 1️⃣ Are you building frontend in?

* React?
* HTML CSS?
* MERN full?

### 2️⃣ What exactly is in Figma student section?

* Dashboard?
* Job list?
* Apply page?

### 3️⃣ What do you want first?

Pick one:

A. Student Dashboard code
B. Job list UI
C. Apply job flow
D. Full student module roadmap
E. Connect backend to frontend

Just reply like:

> Start with Job list page

Then I’ll build it step-by-step with you.

Bahut sahi question 👏
Ab tum **real-world logic** soch rahe ho — yehi actual project thinking hoti hai.

Tumhara doubt 3 parts me hai:

1. Kya Placement Dept dono ko verify karega? (Student + Alumni?)
2. Verification ka base kya hoga?
3. Kya pehle se data rahega ya email se verify hoga?

Chalo real college-level practical answer dete hain 👇

---

# 🎓 1️⃣ Kisko Verify Karna Chahiye?

## ✅ Alumni → **Hamesha Verify karna chahiye**

Kyun?

* Wo external ho chuke hote hain
* Koi bhi fake banda alumni banke register kar sakta hai
* Job posting aur mentorship sensitive cheezein hain

👉 Isliye alumni approval mandatory hona chahiye.

---

## 🤔 Student → Depends on College System

### 🔹 Case A: College ke paas already student database hai

(Enrollment number, batch, branch)

👉 To auto verification ho sakta hai.

Student jab register kare:

* Enrollment number enter kare
* System check kare database me hai ya nahi
* Agar match → auto verified

Placement Dept ko manually verify nahi karna padega.

---

### 🔹 Case B: College ke paas digital student database nahi hai

👉 Tab student ko bhi admin verify karega.

But real life me:

* College ke paas student data hota hi hai
* Isliye students ko manually verify karna inefficient hoga

---

# 🏫 Real-World College Implementation

Most practical model:

| Role    | Verification                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Student | Auto verify using enrollment number + college email |
| Alumni  | Manual verify by Placement Dept                     |

---

# 📧 Alumni Verification Kaise Hoga?

## Option 1: Email-based verification only ❌ (Weak)

Koi bhi Gmail bana ke fake alumni ban sakta hai.

Not secure enough.

---

## Option 2: Enrollment Number + Batch + Department Check ✅

Admin check karega:

* Enrollment number
* Passing year
* Branch
* LinkedIn
* Company details

Agar data match karta hai old records se → approve.

---

## Option 3: Hybrid Model (Best)

Alumni:

* Register kare
* Required details fill kare
* Admin dashboard me "Pending Alumni"
* Admin verify kare old records se
* Approve

---

# 📊 To Final Decision Kya Rakho?

If you want a real deployable college system:

### ✔ Students → Auto Verified

Reason: They already exist in current college database.

### ✔ Alumni → Manual Verified

Reason: Security + fake prevention.

---

# 🧠 Important Logical Answer

Tumhara main question tha:

> Kya pehle se data rahega?

### Real Answer:

* Students ka data already hota hai (current college records)
* Alumni ka old record ho sakta hai, but not always digital
* Isliye alumni manual verification better hai

---

# 🚀 Agar Tum Professional Banana Chahte Ho

System me yeh logic rakho:

* Student registration allowed only with official college email (e.g., @cdgi.edu.in)
* Alumni approval only after admin verification
* Admin ko dashboard me comparison view mile

---

# 🎯 Short Final Answer

Placement department ko:

* Students ko auto-verify karna chahiye (existing data ke basis pe)
* Alumni ko manually verify karna chahiye (security reason se)

---

Agar tum chaho to main tumhe bata sakta hoon:

* Kaunsa model production me safest hai
* Kaunsa model easy implement hoga
* Kaunsa model scalable hoga

Ab tum real system design level pe aa gaye ho 💪
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Excellent 👌
Yeh **very important real-world logic question** hai.

Tum puch rahe ho:

> Agar student 2026 me passout ho gaya, toh kya next year wo automatically alumni ban jayega?

Short answer:
👉 **Yes — but automatically role change hona chahiye, new account nahi banana chahiye.**

Ab detail me samjhte hain 👇

---

# 🎓 Real System Logic

## 🔹 Student → Alumni Transition

Jab student passout ho jata hai:

* Wo system me already registered user hai
* Uska data already Users collection me hai
* Bas uska **role change hoga**

### Example:

Before Graduation:

```
role: "student"
graduationYear: 2026
```

After Graduation:

```
role: "alumni"
```

Bas. New account ki zarurat nahi.

---

# 🏫 Real College Implementation Kaise Hota Hai?

## ✅ Option 1 (Best & Professional Way)

System automatically check kare:

If:

```
currentYear > graduationYear
```

Then:

```
role = alumni
```

Yeh cron job / yearly update se ho sakta hai.

---

## 🤔 But Important Question

Kya automatically alumni ko full access milna chahiye?

Answer: ❌ No.

Kyun?

* Alumni role me job posting allowed hai
* Mentorship allowed hai
* Sensitive features hote hain

Toh best practice kya hai?

---

# 🔐 Recommended Professional Flow

### Step 1: Student graduates

System automatically:

```
role = alumni
approvalStatus = Pending
```

### Step 2:

Placement department confirm kare:

* Kya student actually passout hua?
* Koi pending issue to nahi?

### Step 3:

Admin approve kare → Alumni fully active

---

# 🧠 Why This Is Smart?

✔ Duplicate account nahi
✔ Clean lifecycle management
✔ Data consistent
✔ Secure control

---

# 🔄 Final Lifecycle Model

| Stage     | Role    | Verified?     |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Studying  | student | auto-verified |
| Graduated | alumni  | pending       |
| Approved  | alumni  | approved      |

---

# 🎯 Real-World Best Practice

Student → Alumni conversion automatic
Alumni privileges → manual approval

---

# 🔥 Professional System Design Line

> “We implemented a lifecycle-based role transition where students automatically become alumni after graduation, but alumni privileges are activated only after placement department verification.”

---

Tum ab actual production-level thinking kar rahe ho 👏

Agar chaho to main tumhe full **User Lifecycle Architecture** bana ke explain kar sakta hoon — from admission to alumni mentorship.
